# Raspberry Pi System Load LED
This contains just a script that you can run and have visual feedback of your CPU average load for the past minute.

Also, here's a video showing exactly what this does: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k0FLhkswZg)

It requires that you have a Raspberry Pi and a SMD 5050 RGB LED. You also have to change pins variables so that they'll point where you stuck the cables.

I have:
 - a Raspberry Pi 3 model B like any other
 - and [THIS](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3-Colour-RGB-SMD-LED-Module-5050-full-color-Pwm-tri-color-LED-For-Arduino-MCU/32818529969.html) LED board. I preffered this one because it's compact and I don't have to link the resistors to the LED.
